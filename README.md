This is a repository with my commonly-shared scripts for familiarizing new students with R and microbial ecology analyses. 

 <strong> 1. read_data_and_metadata </strong>
 <em><p><tab>This contains an R script and example data. The objective is to read in datasheet with both sample metadata + data to R using the readxl package, then split into two dataframes (data and metadata).</em></p>
 
<strong> 2. quick_ASV_analyses </strong>
<em><p>This contains an R script and example data. The objective is to read in a processed amplicon datasheet (with both data and metadata) to R using the readxl package, and to conduct various quick analyses (NMDS ordination, taxonomy barplots, diversity calculations) using the vegan and ggplot2 packages.</em></p>

<strong> 3. procrustes_envfit </strong>
<em><p>This contains an R script and example data. The objective is to read in two datasets (metabolite and amplicon) to R, generate two ordinations, calculate significant loadings, and run a procrustes analysis between the two ordinations.</em></p>
